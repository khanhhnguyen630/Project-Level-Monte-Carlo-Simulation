# Monte Carlo Simulation for Project-Level Business Case (Excel-Based)

This project models a comprehensive business case using **Monte Carlo simulation** in Excel to forecast a project's financial performance. It helps evaluate risk-adjusted returns, revenue forecasts, and cost variabilities by simulating 5,000 trial scenarios based on probabilistic assumptions.

---

## Project Overview

The simulation analyzes how uncertainties in input variables (e.g. demand, selling price, development cost, HR expenditure) affect key financial outputs, including:

- Revenue
- Net profit/loss
- Investment returns (IRR, NPV)
- Best case, worst case, and average scenarios

The goal is to support decision-making by providing a **data-driven, probabilistic model** rather than relying on single-point estimates.

## Key Features

- **5,000 Monte Carlo trials** simulating multiple financial years
- **Uniform Distribution, Truncated Normal Distribution, and Triangular distributions** applied to key input assumptions
- Scenario logic sheets showing lowest, average, and highest outcomes
- Visualization-ready summaries to inform investment decisions
